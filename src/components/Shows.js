                equality activism in Madison, how people misuse statistics, what
                can be learned from watching 100 Hallmark movies, how to perform
                self-surgery, and much, much more. Past presenters span local
                entrepreneurs, professors, researchers, activists, union
                organizers, surgeons, engineers, and stand-up comedians with an
                itch to nerd out on stage.
